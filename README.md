# Brain-tumor-classification-using-MR-images
This repo contains all the source code for my brain tumor classification and segmentation web app using brain MR images. An ensemble model was used for the detection and classification phase, and a res-UNET segmentation model for the segmentation phase. A web app was built using the DASH python library. The final models were then converted into a .tflite model and was deployed on a raspberry pi.
